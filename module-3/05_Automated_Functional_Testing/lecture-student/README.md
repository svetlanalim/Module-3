# How to get Selenium / ChromeDriver to work on your machine  
  
  
### Download ChromeDriver:
  - Note your current version of your normal Chrome browser
    - Open Chrome
    - Click the menu (in the upper-right corner, the three vertical dots under the X)
    - Point to `Help`
    - Select `About Google Chrome`
  - Navigate to [ChromeDriver Downloads page](https://chromedriver.chromium.org/downloads)
  - Download the version of ChromeDriver that corresponds to the version of Chrome you have by clicking on the appropriate link, then selecting `chromedriver_win32.zip`
  - Unzip the file you downloaded, which should produce your `chromedriver.exe` executable.  
  - Put your `chromedriver.exe` file in your home directory (`~`)

### Make sure Windows will allow it to run:
  - Now double-click on `chromedriver.exe` to launch it.
  - Windows may pop-up a "Windows protected your PC" message. If so:
    - Click `More info`
    - Click `Run anyway`
  - ChromeDriver should now be able to run! Click on the X to close it.
